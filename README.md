 # React-Weather.app
 
Weather app that gets your location and shows the temperature of the day and the forecast for the next few days. The weather data was obtained using the OpenWeather API and the app was made using React, styled components, custom hooks, context API, and typescript. This project still requires some touch ups, but you can check it out by [clicking here](luisa-weatherapp).
